# Levels of measurement

A variable can be categorized as one of the following, in order of increasing information value:

* A categorical variable values are just names, that indicate no ordering. An example is fruit: you've got apples and oranges, there is no order in these. A special case is a binominal is a variable that can only assume one of two values, true or false, heads or tails and the like. Churn and prospect/customer variables are more specific examples of binominal variables.
* An ordinal variable contains values that can be ordered like ranks and scores. You can say that one value higher than the other, but you can't say one value is 2 times more important. An example of this is army ranks: a General is higher in rank than a Major, but you can't say a General outranks a Major 2 times.
* Interval variables
* Ratio variables

# Kinds of test

# Putting it all together
| Goal | Binominal | Rank/Score | Normally distributed | 
| :--- | :-------- | :--------- | :------------------- |
| Describe one group | [Proportion](/nonparametric-tests/#Proportion), Mode | Mode, Median, Interquartile Range | Mean, SD |
| 1 Sample | Chi-square, Binominal test | Wilcoxon text | One sample t-test |
| 2 Unrelated samples | Chi-square | Mann-Whitney test | Unpaired t-test |
| 2 Related samples | McNemar's test | Wilcoxon test | Paired t-test |
| Association 2 variables | Contigency coefficients | Spearman correlation | Pearson correlation |
