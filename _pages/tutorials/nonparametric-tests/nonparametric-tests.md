* A binominal is a variable that can only assume one of two values, true or false, heads or tails and the like. 
* An ordinal variable contains values that can be ordered
* Interval variables
* Ratio variables

| Goal | Binominal | Rank/Score | Normally distributed | 
| :--- | :-------- | :--------- | :------------------- |
| Describe one group | [Proportion](/nonparametric-tests/#Proportion), Mode | Mode, Median, Interquartile Range | Mean, SD |
| 1 Sample | Chi-square, Binominal test | Wilcoxon text | One sample t-test |
| 2 Unrelated samples | Chi-square | Mann-Whitney test | Unpaired t-test |
| 2 Related samples | McNemar's test | Wilcoxon test | Paired t-test |
| Association 2 variables | Contigency coefficients | Spearman correlation | Pearson correlation |
