Since I'm lazy I generally prefer one file when importing CSV files, but some people prefer split files (for very good reasons). So there are times when I have to split a big file for somebody into smaller files, and there are times when somebody provides me with a set of files thaty I want to put in the same data frame. In this tutorial I'll walk you through both scenario's using ";"-delimited CSV files, but you can quite easily adjust it to any file type you'd want.

# Splitting files

```r

```

# Combining files
