# Levels of measurement

A variable can be categorized as one of the following levels of measurements, in order of increasing information value:

* A **categorical** variable values are just names, that indicate no ordering. An example is fruit: you've got apples and oranges, there is no order in these. A special case is a binominal is a variable that can only assume one of two values, true or false, heads or tails and the like. Churn and prospect/customer variables are more specific examples of binominal variables.
* An **ordinal** variable contains values that can be ordered like ranks and scores. You can say that one value higher than the other, but you can't say one value is 2 times more important. An example of this is army ranks: a General is higher in rank than a Major, but you can't say a General outranks a Major 2 times.
* A **interval** variable has values that are ordered, and the difference between has meaning, but there is no absolute 0 point, which makes it difficult to interpret differences in terms of absolute magnitude. Money value is an example of an interval level variable, which may sound a bit counterintuitive. Money can take negative values, which makes it impossible to say that someone with 1 million Euros on his bank account has twice as much money as someone that has 1 million Euros in debt.
* A **ratio** variable has values like interval variables, but here there is an absolute 0 point. 0 Kelvin is an example: there is no temperature below 0 Kelvin, which also means that the 700 degrees Kelvin is twice as hot as 350 degrees Kelvin. Quantities are the only example in my field that I know of.

# Kinds of test

# Putting it all together
| Goal | Binominal | Rank/Score | Normally distributed | 
| :--- | :-------- | :--------- | :------------------- |
| Describe one group | [Proportion](/nonparametric-tests/#Proportion), Mode | Mode, Median, Interquartile Range | Mean, SD |
| 1 Sample | Chi-square, Binominal test | Wilcoxon text | One sample t-test |
| 2 Unrelated samples | Chi-square | Mann-Whitney test | Unpaired t-test |
| 2 Related samples | McNemar's test | Wilcoxon test | Paired t-test |
| Association 2 variables | Contigency coefficients | Spearman correlation | Pearson correlation |
