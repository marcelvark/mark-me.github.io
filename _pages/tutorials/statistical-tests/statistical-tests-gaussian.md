This tutorial is the last in a series of four. This part shows you how to apply and interpret the tests for ratio variables with a normal (Gaussian) distribution. [This link](/statistical-tests/) will get you back to the first part of the series.

A **ratio** variable has values like interval variables, but here there is an absolute 0 point. 0 Kelvin is an example: there is no temperature below 0 Kelvin, which also means that the 700 degrees Kelvin is twice as hot as 350 degrees Kelvin. Quantities are the only example in my field that I know of. 

## Descriptive

Sometimes you just want to describe one variable. Although these types of descriptions don't need statistical tests, I'll describe them here since they should be a part of interpreting the statistical test results. Statistical tests say whether they change, but descriptions on distibutions tell you in what direction they change.

### Mean, SD



## One sample

One sample tests are done when you want to find out whether your measurements differ from some kind of theorethical distribution. For example: you might want to find out whether you have a dice that doesn't get the random result you'd expect from a dice. In this case you'd expect that the dice would throw 1 to 6 about 1/6th of the time.

### One sample t-test

## Two unrelated samples

Unrelated sample tests can be used for analysing marketing tests; you apply some kind of marketing voodoo to two different groups of prospects/customers and you want to know which method was best. 

### Unpaired t-test

## Two unrelated samples

The related samples tests are used to determine whether there are differences before and after some kind of treatment. It is also useful when seeing when verifying the predictions of machine learning algorithms.

### Paired t-test

## Association between 2 variables

Tests of association determine what the strength of the movement between variables is. It can be used if you want to know if there is any relation between the customer's amount spent, and the number of orders the customer already placed. 

### Pearson correlation
