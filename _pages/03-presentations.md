Now and then I give presentations to collegues. I collect those here.

* [Machine learning for the laymen](/machine-learning-layman/) – A presentation given to my collegues of Marketing showing them what machine learning is, the classes of algorithms and some examples of those.
* [Use case R](/use-case-r/) – The first presentation I gave to my collegues of Analytics to show them my findings while using R for the first time. Sorry: it’s in Dutch.
